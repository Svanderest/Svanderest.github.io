        <h3>Password Reset Tool</h3>
        <p>The password reset tool is a web application developed for the City of St Catharines to support legacy applications whose built in password reset features were lacking. It combines Active Directory, AspNet Identity and Oracle Authentication to authenticate and track users, and to reset their passwords. The tool in its current form was built mostly on my initiative.</p>

        <h3>Feekeeper</h3>
        <p>Feekeeper is a tool developped for the City of St Catharines to update municipal rates and fees, mostly related to building permits. It is an ASP.NET web application connected to the same Oracle database as the municipal permitting application, CSDC Amanda. The tool was developed to accomodate a version upgrade to CSDC Amanda which would otherwise have broken the exisinting fee updating process. Development of this application also included a much needed audit of existing fee procedures.</p>

        <h3>ESP 2015</h3>
        <p>The Electron Spin Propram (ESP) is a scientific program initially developed at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin in the late 1980's to capture and analyse the results of experiments in electron spin resonance. In 2015, I was given the taks of modernising the build of the program currently in use at Brock University. In particular, I changed the output file format from raw binary to plain text, since constraints on hard drive are not nearly as tight as they were thiry years ago, and I created a graphical user interface, since many of the program's users were not particularly comfortable with the command line</p>
